To run the levelBuilder run main.java by default a new level will open for editing. You can close that level by pressing the "x" button in the top right corner of the panel.

Once the level is closed, you can open a "new level" for editing by going to "file -> create new level"

In order to run the level builder you must have the WildSixesGame project! The builder imports classes from the Game.

To use a new level in the game, overwrite one of the levels in the WildSixesGame/src/LevelTemplates folder and refresh the workspace.
